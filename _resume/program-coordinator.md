[Milestone Deadline Extensions Form (PDF)]("assets/samples/exam-deadline-extension-petition.pdf"): I used Adobe Acrobat to create this form. This form is loosely based on [this form](). The Ph.D. program has set timeframe deadlines for milestones to be completed, and this form is used to record the student's need for an extension. The form asks for the student, advisor, and a graduate advising staff member to sign. The team processes about 6 or 7 of these every academic quarter. Prior to the creation of this form, the students were asked to have a conversation with their advisor and then to contact graduate advising by email. There was a need for there to be documentation regarding this process, in order to provide data to the faculty when they are reviewing the degree program's time-to-completion and student satisfaction. The signature process is handled via DocuSign. I created a Powerform so that student could initiate the form themselves. The form is sent first to the student, then to the student's advisor(s), and finally to the graduate advising team to file in the student's record.
