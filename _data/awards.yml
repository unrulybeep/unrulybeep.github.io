  description: "The Summer Institute in the Arts and Humanities (SIAH) offers a
  research opportunity for undergraduates to engage in scholarly research with
  accomplished scholars and peers while earning full-time academic credit. This
  scholarly experience occurs in the context of seminars and tutorial-style
  lessons with faculty who offer expertise from disciplinary and
  interdisciplinary points of view in a space that encourages mutual learning
  with peers as well as independent thought. Student participants develop
  individual, original research ideas related to an interdisciplinary theme,
  create a scholarly research paper or project, work through a faculty and peer
  critique process and formally present their work to their colleagues and the
  larger community at a closing symposium."
