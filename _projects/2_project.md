While I was an undergraduate, I was selected as a 2018 Mary Gates’ Scholar for the Summer Institute of Arts & Humanities [Institute Homepage](https://www.washington.edu/undergradresearch/siah/archive/2018-siah).

My research project involved Indigenous Research methodologies paired with technology tools that helped not only reshape the way academics are engaging with historical and archival data, but also in using technology to bring that into the homes and lives of folks who don’t have the same opportunities. This project was driven by my own upbringing as a low-income kid from small-town Georgia that was desperate to find an environment that didn’t spurn me when I tried to speak my truth. The teaching team for included Lauren Berliner, who has published research (Producing Queer Youth: The Paradox of Digital Media Empowerment and Feminist Interventions in Participatory Media: Pedagogy, Publics, Practice) focused on queer youth and how they have found space on the internet to build community and experience the world outside their family enclaves.
