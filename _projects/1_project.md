The goal of the assignment

I refer to this style of work as digital collage, as all the images are found and used to convey further meaning to my prose. The bottom-left image on page 6, for example, is comprised of several other images. I created this scene to replicate my birthhome, in which I carry a vivid memory of fear. The faux-wooden panel was one image, the sofa another, the shadow-couple was its own image that I also rotated to mimick my memory. The human figure is actress Ricki Lake from a movie called [Baby Cakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Cakes_(film)).

The rest of the page consists of a bottom layer of the Duluth's Model [Wheel of Violence](https://www.theduluthmodel.org/wheels/faqs-about-the-wheels), and then scenes from my marriage. I was struggling with the toxicity within my marriage, and the Women and Violence course was invoking things I had tried hard to hide. As I was learning about [positionality and intersectional feminism](https://indigenousinitiatives.ctlt.ubc.ca/classroom-climate/positionality-and-intersectionality), I decided to layer affinity labels on to the figure that represents my ex-husband. I found I was having difficulty recognizing the dynamic I was in due to stereotypes and norms.
