title:  "Qualifying Evaluation Internal Tool"
collection: resume
---

A particularly impactful accomplishment has been having self-taught React.js to
develop a web application that tracks students’ progress through their degree
benchmarks such as the Ph.D. Qualifying Examination. When initial challenges
arose relating to credentialing and security of protected student information,
I worked with software developers on the Allen School’s support team to develop
an internal tool and port over my original designs and code. The final product
utilizes PHP and SQL on the backend and is utilized by 400 students, staff, and
faculty annually. I taught myself how to use React during the
[DUB Hack’20 hackathon](https://hack20.dubhacks.co). https://codepen.io/ellesedai/pen/qBZXBxM
