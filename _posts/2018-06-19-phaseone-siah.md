Dr. Magelssen's rendition of the UW-Seattle campus' dark tour drew me in. In addition to the recording I made, I decided to make a map of the destinations. I thought about using Google Maps, but I didn't want to be locked into Google's framework. I tried out using a static map and adding markers in Photoshop, but I wasn't quite sure how something like that operated.

[ArcGIS Map](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=5d35b3ee22bb4a229e58d4d2a14cd19b) I placed the points and created the data inside the pop-up when you click on the location. Some of the data is from the dark tour, but a lot of it I discovered on my own time.
