  I became a notary public in the state of Washington in November of 2022. I
  have both an electronic and [remote](https://www.nationalnotary.org/notary-bulletin/blog/2018/06/remote-notarization-what-you-need-to-know) endorsement, which allows me to sign virtual documents as long as I am in the same location as the client. If my client is not able to be in the same location as me, we can use a third-party service to complete a remote transaction. I received professional training from [Attorney & Notary Supply, Inc.](https://ans-inc.net), in Renton, WA. I am based in South Seattle, and I also frequent the University of Washington Seattle campus.

            Yes. If remote signing is not an option, and you are unable to come to
            my location, I can travel to you in order to complete the signing.
            There will be an additional $20 fee assessment within the service area.
            If you are outside my service area, please contact me for a quote.

            <strong>This is the third item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
