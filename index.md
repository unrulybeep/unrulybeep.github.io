I fell in love with technology as a smalltown-youth using HTML to decorate for
my AOL profile. After that, I found an online community of roleplayers where I
learned {% glossary Softcode %}. I am a skilled reader and debugger of code,
and I am adept at reviewing existing or problematic code to identify and
reverse-engineer elegant solution. Softcode created a foundation for my
understanding of computer programming languages that has served me well.
